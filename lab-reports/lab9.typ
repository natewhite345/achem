4. Given that we only have three data points for each category, there is insufficient power to determine based on our samples alone which characteristics are the same or different between the wine samples. All observed and computed values are relatively similar to roughly the same extent. The unknown wine is closer to the white wine for cathodic measurements and closer to the Rose for anodic measurements. 

The potential for ferricyanide vs Ag/AgCl can be computed from literature as 360 mV - 220 mV = 140 mV. It was not recorded experimentally during this lab due to explicit instruction by a TA.

Our blank reading showed strong repeated evidence of contamination with observed peaks similar to our voltammograms for the wine sample, thus we did not subtract our blank for our data analysis.
