+ Performing linear regression on the peak area from our caffeine standard calibration curve yields a slope of 11169.7 AU/#math.mu;L stock solution and a y-intercept of 70876.1 AU. Our area for the peak corresponding to caffeine for anacin had an area of 3228713 AU, which corresponds to 282.714 #math.mu;L stock solution on the calibration curve. Some simple dimensional analysis yields that $("282.714 "#math.mu;L" stock solution")/ (1000 #math.mu;L "anacin solution") * "250 mL anacin solution" = 1/4 * "282.714 mL stock solution" = 1/4 * "282.714 mL stock solution" * "12.4 mg caffeine" / "25 mL stock solution" = 35.1 $ mg caffeine in the anacin tablet.
+ The sample was 507.6 mg, so the tablet is 6.91% caffeine w/w. 
+ N/A, only one replicate
+ Result seems reasonably close to the expected value of 32 mg.
