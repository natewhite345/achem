+ Using the y-intercept of the regression (74256.3) as the standard deviation of the blank, the limit of detection and limit of quantitation can be determined as 222769 and 742563 respectively. The signal from both the lemon and grapefruit samples fall within this range, indicating that the data is insufficient to make a quantitative determination of the weight percentage of limonene in either citrus fruits; however, it is sufficient to determine that there is limonene present. To obtain qualititative results, a new calibration curve should be created with standards that have lower concentrations, or the samples should be less diluted. A possible source of error resulting in lower than expected concentrations of is insufficient extraction of the limonene from the rind which could be fixed through smaller piece fragments, a longer time spent agitated in the methanol, or a better solvent.
