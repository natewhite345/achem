    + Fill a 50 mL beaker with around 40 mL of DI water; set aside. 
    + Using a P50 micropipette, dispense 25.0 #math.mu;L of the 40.0 mg/mL food coloring solution into a 10.0 mL volumetric flask. 
    + Using the DI water from Step 1, fill that volumetric flask to the mark. A transfer pipette should be used when approaching the mark for finer control to avoid overshooting.
    + Cap the volumetric flask and invert 20 times to mix.
    + Using the P1000 micropipette, transfer 500 #math.mu;L from the volumetric flask into a new 25.0 mL volumetric flask. Using the DI water from Step 1, fill that volumetric flask to the mark, using a transfer pipette when approaching the mark to avoid overshooting.
    + Cap the volumetric flask and invert 20 times to mix.
    + Three cuvettes should be prepared for UV-Vis by wiping the clear sides of the cuvette with a KimWipe and ensuring that only the frosted sides are touched from that point until retrieval from the UV-Vis machines.
    + Use a transfer pipette to fill each cuvette with about 3 mL (3 cm) of solution.
    + Use the UV-Vis machine to record the absorption for each cuvette at 503 nm.

+ The final solution of my SOP has a concentration of $2 times 10^3 "ng/mL"$. This is the same as in Problem 3. Therefore, I expect the solution to have an absorbance of 0.10.
+ My answers are the same because the questions are the same.
