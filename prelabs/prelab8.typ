+ No, the purpose of potassium nitrate is as an electrolyte. It was specifically chosen because it is not redox active; if it was, it would interfere with our measurements. The blank will be a graph along the x-axis with only noise, since there will be no reactions occuring so no current flowing between the working and counter electrode.

+ E#sub[0]=0.36 mV. However, we are using a Ag/AgCl electrode as reference, which has a potential of 0.22 mV relative to SHE. Thus, the observed E#super[0] will be 0.14 mV. An appropriate value for X is 0.30 mV. An appropriate value for #math.tau is between 250-500 ms.
