= Procedure:
== Gathering materials
== Preparation of Standard
// 0.97*0.842g/mL* 10^(-6) * 200/ 25 * 153 / 10  to micrograms / milliliter
+ Pour roughly 1 mL of (R)-(+)-Limonene (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number 183164) into a 5 mL beaker.
+ Pour roughly 75 mL of methanol into a 100 mL beaker
+ Using a P200, transfer 200 #math.mu;L of the limonene from the beaker into a 10 mL volumetric flask.
+ Fill the volumetric flask to the mark with methanol. 
+ Obtain a 5 mL beaker and pour about 1 mL of this dilution.
+ Using a P200, transfer 153 #math.mu;L of the dilution from the beaker into a 25 mL volumetric flask. Label this flask "S100". 
+ Mix "S100" by 20x inversion.
+ Gather four 10 mL volumetric flasks and stoppers. Label them "S50", "S25", "S12.5", and "S6.25" (corresponding to their concentrations in #math.mu;g/mL)
+ Obtain a 5 mL volumetric pipette and bulb.
+ Transfer 5 mL of methanol into each of the four volumetric flasks, placing a stopper on each immediately after to avoid evaporation.
+ Use a transfer pipette to fill the "S50" flask to the mark with the contents of the "S100" flask.
+ Mix "S50" by 20x inversion. 
+ Use a new transfer pipette to fill the "S25" flask to the mark with "S50", and mix by inversion. Repeat this process to create the other two standards.
== Extraction of Limonene from Fruit
+ Gather three 7 mL vials. Label as "G", "O", and "L" (for grapefruit, orange, and lemon).
+ Using a razor blade, collect a piece of the rind of a grapefruit, lemon, and orange around a fingerprint size in area. Ensure that the none of the white flesh is included in the sample. 
+ From each rind piece, mass and record a roughly 0.1 g sample.
+ Place this rind piece in the appropriate vial. 
+ Transfer 5 mL of methanol into each vial. 
+ Shake each vial vigorously for 5 minutes, then let each vial rest for 5 minutes.
+ Using a P500, transfer
