+ Solution A has a peak around 410nm, which is violet. If it absorbs violet, then the apparent color will be yellow. Solution B has a peak around 490nm, which is blue. If it absorbs blue, then the apparent color will be orange. Solution C has a peak around 590nm, which is yellow. Thus the apparent color will be violet. Solution D has a peak around 720nm, which is red, but has a very broad left shoulder, so the apparent color will be blueshifted from bluegreen to blue.

  + We can rearrange Beer's Law from $A_(lambda)=epsilon_(lambda)c l$ to $c = A_(lambda)/(epsilon_(lambda)l)$. Substituting in values from the problem yields $0.427/(6.130" M"^(-1)"cm"^(-1) times "1.000 cm") = 6.97 times 10^(-5)$ M. 
  + $c times frac("1.00 mL", "10.00 mL") = 6.97 times 10^(-5)" M" arrow.double c = 6.97 times 10^(-4)" M"$
  + $6.97 times 10^(-4)" M" * 5" mL" times frac("1 L", "1000 mL") times "292.16 g/mol" times "1000 mg"/"1 g" = 1.02$ mg

  + Light at 430 nm is violet-blue.
  + Light at 600 nm is orange
  + A substance absorbing violet-blue light will appear yellow
  + A substance absorbing orange light will appear blue
