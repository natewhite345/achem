+ Solution A has a peak around 410nm, which is violet. If it absorbs violet, then the apparent color will be yellow. Solution B has a peak around 490nm, which is blue. If it absorbs blue, then the apparent color will be orange. Solution C has a peak around 590nm, which is yellow. Thus the apparent color will be violet. Solution D has a peak around 720nm, which is red, but has a very broad left shoulder, so the apparent color will be blueshifted from bluegreen to blue.

  + We can rearrange Beer's Law from $A_(lambda)=epsilon_(lambda)c l$ to $c = A_(lambda)/(epsilon_(lambda)l)$. Substituting in values from the problem yields $0.427/(6.130" M"^(-1)"cm"^(-1) times "1.000 cm") = 6.97 times 10^(-5)$ M.
